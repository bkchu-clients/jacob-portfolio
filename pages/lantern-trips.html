              Lantern Trips is a mobile application that aims to simplify trip planning and become the most trusted source for travel. Although Lantern Trips has conducted market research, defined features, and identified target users, they wish to assess and iterate on what exists in the market so they can deliver a competitive app.

            <p class="overview__text mb-12">
              <strong>The Challenge:</strong>
              How do we design for collaborative travel during a trip where everyone can share and contribute?

            <p class="overview__text mb-12">
              <strong>The Solution:</strong>
              We designed a mobile app that allows travelers to create an itinerary, collaborate on activities and share their moments on social media.

            The companies that we thought best represented Lantern Trips values were Bonjournal, TripAdvisor, Tripcast and Trippy. By doing a heuristic evaluation and competitive analysis on current market leaders we realized a few things.

            My team conducted user interviews to empathize with our target audience to find out what aspects of travel inspired them and what pain points they came across. After identifying qualified participants, we ended with a sample pool of 15 people and took their key points and conducted an affinity diagram.

              - Planning with people is difficult because it's hard to share between platforms.

              We held a design studio with our client to collaboratively come up with different iterations on prioritized features. After multiple rounds of designing, we were able to focus our solutions on the following topics:
              <strong>
                Collaborative Planning, Content Sharing and Documenting to Social Media.
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              By creating a low-fidelity prototype we were able to get feedback on the features we decided were the most practical and important for an MVP. Our team went through multiple rounds of user testing with paper prototypes and medium-fidelity wireframes.

            1. Users complained that the "segment page" was too condensed and that they wanted to view more segment details before clicking "going".
            <br />
            2. Users wished that they could preview the section on their schedule before approving the segment.
            <br />
            3. Users wanted icons on "itinerary page" to be more prominent. The "share" icon caused too much delay in performing main task due to the placement of the button.
            <br />
            4. Users wanted to see an "album block" section on the "segment page" so that they can preview what photos already exist for that section.
            <br />
            5. Users were confused with the CTAs (delete selected photos and cancel) on the "carousel image page".

          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m">
            1. There was a lot of visual confusion on the page due to the different icons. We saw that users weren't benefiting from an overview of who was in the photo album, so we changed the naming convention to text.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Users were confused that a stack of photos was differentiated by just a number on the photo. We changed the stack to be visually different from a single photo by adding a "stacked" photo effect.

          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m mb-24">
            We presented our prototype to our client and showed them the features that would be included in the MVP. Moving forward, we suggested a few things:
          </p>
          <div class="cs__box cs__box--gray width-10 width-8@m mb-24">
            <p class="cs__text">
              After user testing with multiple people, we found that it would be much easier on the client's developer if Lantern Trips was integrated with another app that is already utilized by travelers such as DropBox or Google Photos in order to share/store content. We told them to explore different options like implementing another platform or simplifying the content in order to solve the learnability issue.
            </p>

          <div class="cs__box cs__box--gray width-10 width-8@m">
            <p class="cs__text">
              We encouraged our client to continue usability testing on the MVP as well as the overall layout of the app with the prototype and the high-fidelity wireframes.

          <h3 class="cs__subheader subheader width-10">What I Learned</h3>
          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m">
            Working with clients won’t always be easy. Luckily, our client was willing to compromise on features to finish the design sprint and focus on what users told us during testing. I had to be able to justify a design change not based on personal bias but from user feedback. As we constantly iterated on our designs I had to learn to accept design changes and not get caught up with just the visuals.
