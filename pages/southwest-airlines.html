            <p class="cs__text mb-12">Southwest Cargo provides fast and efficient shipping services for valued customers around the country. As a subsidiary of Southwest Airlines, Southwest Cargo focuses on enhancing customer experience with every package that is shipped.</p>
            <p class="cs__text">My team consisted of 6 members. Two designers, one project manager and three UI developers. Before we began designing, a different agency had previously provided some mockups that we based our designs on. With the provided wireframes, my experience director and I finished all the designs while making them responsive. We collaborated with the client’s team to finish this project in 6 design sprints.</p>

            <p class="cs__text mb-12"><strong>The Solution:</strong> We created a responsive web-based experience that emulates Southwest’s digital branding to allow for smooth transitions into next generation designs.</p>
            <p class="cs__text"><strong>My Role:</strong> Along with my Experience Director, Lan Nguyen, I was the experience designer who focused on creating high fidelity wireframes, IA documentation and design patterns.</p>

            <p class="cs__text mb-24">We began each sprint by prioritizing features. Once we figured out which features were high-priority I began designing wireframes.</p>

            <h4 class="cs__text bold mb-4">2. Design Review</h4>
            <p class="cs__text mb-24">We presented our designs to our main stakeholders on a weekly basis to receive feedback as well as approvals.</p>

            <h4 class="cs__text bold mb-4">3. Feedback</h4>
            <p class="cs__text mb-24">In addition to presenting designs to stakeholders, they had the opportunity to look through WIP designs using InVision.</p>

            <p class="cs__text mb-24">Based on feedback, the experience director and I would iterate on our designs and prepare for our sprint review.</p>

          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m mb-12">Before redesigning Southwest Cargo we had to understand how each page interacted with one another. A firm understanding of the taxonomy would solidify how we would organize parent pages, nested pages and external links. After mapping out the current state of Southwest Cargo, our experience director and I went to work. We created a sitemap that efficiently showed how each page interacted within the website while showing which pages could link to another page.</p>
          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m">We saw that the current sitemap did not match the layout of the existing site. In order to update the IA of the website, we needed to discover what pages were linked to other headers and what paths a user could take to complete a task. For example, a user could decide to send a package via NFG (Next Flight Guaranteed) by clicking the header, Ship, and get to the service levels to learn more about that shipping method. The user can also access the information for NFG by clicking the header, Learn, and looking under specialty shipments. A user can take multiple paths to complete a task and we determined these paths on the sitemap above.</p>

          <h3 class="cs__subheader subheader width-10">Prioritizing user needs</h3>
          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m">During sprint planning we had to understand which tasks were the most common and frequent. After talking to our stakeholders and reviewing what the main purpose of the website was we determined a couple high priority user flows. We learned that users go to the Cargo website to locate their nearest shipping facility as well as track shipments.</p>

          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m mb-12">The tracking details page is comprised of multiple cards that show the current status of your shipment, shipper information, consignee information, lot information and total shipment content. Users are able to scroll through the information to look up their shipping details. In order to get to the tracking details page, the user must first choose the right card on the Tracking Results page. We highlighted the airway bill number at the top of each card so a user could tap on the number or the card itself.</p>
          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m">Towards the bottom of the page the user can see their “Lot Tracking Information”. If a shipment has multiple boxes they can be separated and sent on different planes. Visualizing the data for multiple lots was an area that we needed to think more through. Currently, the data is displayed on individual cards but with two or three different lots it can cause problems for the user.</p>

Our goal was to give enough affordance throughout our designs to make it easy for users to locate, ship, learn, and manage shipments.</p>

          <p class="cs__text width-10 width-8@m">We finished the design sprints in 3 months. After multiple iterations, we redesigned Southwest Cargo’s website to be responsive. In order to allow for next generation adjustments, we created a framework that could be applied to current and future designs. The website is now live but we are still in the process of updating UI based on client feedback.</p>

            <p class="cs__text">Research is not just valuable in the early stages of a project but valuable at every stage in the project cycle. As more people start to use Cargo’s new website it is essential to understand how they’re using the product and what features to add. With added time, I’d like to recruit participants who use the Cargo website to ship multiple packages at once. With multiple packages, users are presented with different ‘Lot’ data. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to interview or conduct contextual inquiries to observe how they interpret that data.</p>
