              Fiserv provides financial technology to numerous institutions, credit unions, thrifts and retailers across the country. A trusted fintech company, Fiserv provides their clients with innovative methods and solutions to a range of problems in the fintech space.

            <p class="cs__text mb-12">
              The fintech space has some of the most complicated paths for a user and it was our job to come up with efficient solutions to complete those tasks. Users transfer money to their friends and family for professional services or simply paying the tab at a restaurant. Drawing from my own experiences, user testing and research I was able to immerse myself into the many paths a user can take to complete a transfer.

              My team consisted of over a dozen people. Comprised of designers, developers, project managers, business analysts and QA. Along with our team, we collaborated with Fiserv’s business and technology teams.

              <strong>The Challenge</strong>
              <br />
              The “big picture” challenge was to create a white - label banking application that could be utilized by multiple financial institutions. When the team broke the project down to different features, I was tasked to build the transfer feature. I had to logically build out multiple flows where a consumer could make a simple one - time transfer or a more complicated transfer, a recurring transfer that took place on the 1st and 15th of every month.

              <br />
              Along with the rest of the design team, I designed and updated key wireframes but I specifically took ownership of building out the transfer flows. Within this vertical, there were over a dozen paths that a user could choose from as well as multiple variations for each one.

            <p class="cs__text mb-12">
              Throughout the project cycle, our team held over 20 contextual inquiries that helped us iterate on our designs. My team helped our researchers conduct contextual inquiries to assess the mobile application at our in-house usability testing lab. Our researchers screened multiple participants to ensure we were interviewing the target audience. Participants then answered interview questions that included how and when they checked their account summary, and transaction history (to name a few). Through user validation and testing, we had to pivot out designs to meet our user’s needs.
            </p>
            <p class="cs__text">
              The design team sat behind the glass of our usability testing room to listen to feedback given by participants who went through the 7 tasks on the mobile app. Out of the 7, there were 3 tasks that pertained to either setting up a transfer or editing one. I noticed that the majority of participants did not want to receive a notice every time a recurring transfer occurred, whether it be a twice a month transfer or a twice a year transfer. For those who had stricter budgeting, we added a checkbox that allowed users to get a notification after every transfer.

                When we observed users start the transfer process, we noticed that users did not read or may have overlooked the ‘help’ text that is displayed below the header. The text was placed there to explain the limitations of sending a transfer on a weekend or holiday. We saw this as an opportunity to be more explicit with how we displayed the message. We recommended that the text be formatted into a text block that would be displayed with the scheduling dropdown. If the user were to select a date during a weekend or holiday the message would be displayed immediately.

                Users want to be able to tab between ‘Scheduled Transfers’ and ‘Transfer History’ effortlessly when they’re making a transfer. Some of the main reasons to do so are to confirm the process time and date for a transfer or to edit their transfer. The most convenient way is to tap on a scheduled transfer and read the details. Users could not tell that the rows were tappable due to a lack of affordance given to each row. To alleviate the confusion we added a chevron icon to indicate to users that the row expanded to display more detail. We also saw that participants glanced over the statuses. By emphasizing the color treatment and iconography of the current status we were able to capture their attention.

With a simple and intuitive design, users can navigate through the transfer flow by filling in the necessary information. At the start of the transfer flow the user is presented with the basics - From, To, Amount and Scheduling. After iterating on multiple transfer flows and interviewing users throughout the design cycle, we determined three key tasks.</p>

            As a user begins to navigate through the recurring transfers, different inputs appear. For example, a recurring transfer that occurs on a weekly basis has three additional inputs. The user has to select a start on date, pick a duration as well as an end on date. Once we built the recurring transfer flow, our team decided to internally test the flow with people in our office. We asked our testers to explain the flows to us and explain the different inputs that appeared depending on the frequency.

Due to this one - track mind, they often go straight to what needs to be done and overlook the details. Focusing our iterations on the details allowed us to showcase the importance of a ‘help’ message or an alert that would have been overlooked by the user.</p>
            <p class="cs__text">This project has been ongoing for more than a year now. My role was to iterate on past designs that were created by the lead designer, Xavier Harrell, and use research findings to validate my design decisions. Being a part of this project taught me to be transparent with the client. I was able to defend my design decisions and explain to stakeholders why a change was made or why it was necessary to pivot our focus on a feature. I believe that your designs are as good as the research behind it, and luckily, we had the funding and resources to do a lot of it.</p>
